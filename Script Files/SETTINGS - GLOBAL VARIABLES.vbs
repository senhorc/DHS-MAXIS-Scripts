'COUNTY CUSTOM VARIABLES----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'The following variables are dynamically added via the installer. They can be modified manually to make changes without re-running the
'	installer, but doing so should not be undertaken lightly.

'CONFIG FOR HOW SCRIPTS WORK===================

'Default directory: used by the script to determine if we're scriptwriters or not (scriptwriters use a default directory traditionally).
'	This is modified by the installer, which will determine if this is a scriptwriter or a production user.

'Run locally: if this is set to "True", the scripts will run locally and bypass GitHub entirely. This is great for debugging or developing scripts.

'COUNTY NAME AND INFO==========================

'This is used by almost every script which calls a specific agency worker number (like the REPT/ACTV nav and list gen scripts).

'This is used for MEMO scripts, such as appointment letter
county_name = "Anoka County"

'This merely exists to help the installer determine which dropdown box to default. It is not used by any scripts.

'This is an "updated date" variable, which is updated dynamically by the intaller.

'ALL-COUNTY SCRIPT CONFIGURATION===============

'This is used by scripts which tell the worker where to find a doc to send to a client (ie "Send form using Compass Pilot")

'This is used to allow some agencies to decline to case note intake/rein dates on denied progs and closed progs. We're hoping to convince these agencies to case note this info, so that we can drop this field.

'This moves "verifs needed" to be at the top of the CAF case note template, instead of the bottom.

'This threshold is what the BNDX scrubber will use to determine what is considered "within the realm" of the currently budgeted income.

'NAVIGATION SCRIPT CONFIGURATION================

'If all users use "select a worker" nav scripts, this will be True. (Example: case banking county)

'If the above is False, we need a list of workers who do use the "select a worker" nav scripts.
